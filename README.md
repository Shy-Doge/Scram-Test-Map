# Scram Test Map
 This was a Scram test map that I made to test some scripts that might be useful for someone, so I am uploading it here.

To build the mod you need to edit Assembly-CSharp.csproj and add

```
 <Reference Include="Assembly-CSharp">
 <HintPath>PATH_TO_SCRAM_FILES/Scram_Data/Managed/Assembly-CSharp.dll</HintPath>
 </Reference>
 <Reference Include="Sirenix.Serialization">
 <HintPath>PATH_TO_SCRAM_FILES/Scram_Data/Managed/Sirenix.Serialization.dll</HintPath>
 </Reference>
```
